A customised implementation of the AutoVC model. The original implementation from which this repository was built can be found [here](https://github.com/auspicious3000/autovc)
The authors described improvements to this approach using separate conditioning with pitch contours

Changes include:
    Corrections to tensor shapes
    Improved L1Loss implementation
    Customisation to work with the VTCK speech dataset
    The generation of pitch contours in several forms
    Jupyter notebooks
